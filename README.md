## QTL regression on multiple markers

Methodologies

1) Use Lasso, Latent Class Regression for model selection as discussed.

2) Since the model has both quantitative and qualitative factors, we can build a prediction model for phenotypes based on markers and covariates. I worked on this type of problem before. I'd like to apply it for this project. However, I am not sure if this is useful in terms of biology.

3) Apply Gaussian Process Regression to QTL model
